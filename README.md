# Flappy Bird
Inspired by https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets. This project uses python(mainly pygame). Flappy Bird is a game in which you have to try to make your bird avoid as many poles as you can. The poles will spawn at random height and you will hav to try to dodge them. This game is made with one single file and has all the coding in one folder.
